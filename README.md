The NestorPhone is a polyphonic, multi-sample instrument for Ableton Live 11, featuring underwater recordings of Nestor Peixoto's (aka [Æthereal Arthropod](https://aetherealarthropod.bandcamp.com/) Overtone Singing techniques.
Nestor was recorded by Luis Clara Gomes with a pair of Aquarian Audio H2a-XLR hydrophones, during the [MTF Labs Aveiro 2021](https://mtflabs.net/).
